# Gabriel Wagner React Portfolio

This was my first React project. it includes the use of: 

Components: The Portfolio is made up of a number of reusable components. This makes the code easy to maintain and update.

State: I used state to keep track of the current state of the user interface. This allows the user interface to be updated dynamically in response to user input.

Routing: Use of routing to allow users to navigate between different pages. This makes it easy for users to find the information they are looking for.

Styling: The website uses CSS/SASS for many of its stylings and animations. Intentionally tried to appear "flashy".
